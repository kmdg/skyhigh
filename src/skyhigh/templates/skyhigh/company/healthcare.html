                    <p>There is no question that Cloud services have made life simpler for health care organizations. Users benefit from a range of easily-accessible tools like Salesforce.com, Box.Net, Office365 ...and IT has the ability to provide these services without the administration and costs they would incur with traditional applications. Cloud services also minimize the IT burden necessary to comply with HIPAA and Meaningful Use.</p>
                    <p>IT organizations understand that the dynamic nature of Cloud services also make them a huge risk. An approved service that is primarily used for collaboration today can suddenly add capabilities for uploading photos or sensitive content. And while an IT team can put policies in place to block risky applications, new ones pop up every day. These rapidly changing services put even the most secure organizations in jeopardy: from inconsistent policy enforcement to the very real risk of exposing sensitive patient or organizational data, images or intellectual property.</p>
                    <p>Even the most proactive security teams are struggling to keep up with the expanding list of public Cloud services their users access. In fact, recent data shows that a typical mid-size hospital has more that 30 Cloud services running which they didnâ€™t know about - many of which offered capabilities in violation of existing - but unenforceable - policies.</p>
