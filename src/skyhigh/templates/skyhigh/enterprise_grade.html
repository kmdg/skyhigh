                        <h3>2. Operations and Data</h3>
                        <p>Skyhigh Networks Operations partners with trusted industry leaders like Equinix and XO communications to provide a secure, performant, highly available infrastructure. Access to infrastructure is closely controlled and limited to trusted senior team members. Two-factor authentication and IPSec VPNs ensure strong authentication and encryption of data.</p>
                        <h3>3. Security expertise &amp; oversight</h3>
                        <p>Our service was built by <a href="{% url company_leadership %}">a team</a> with a proven track record in enterprise security. Prior to founding Skyhigh Networks, the team was responsible at Cisco for products that enable customers to administer, enforce, and audit standards-based, consistent access policies across the IT stack. The team delivered the Identity Services Engine, a product that won the coveted Pioneer Award in Cisco and is considered to be a game changer for Cisco.</p>
                        <h3>4. Independent Penetration &amp; vulnerability testing</h3>
                        <p>While we audit ourselves continually, we remember Richard Feynman's principle: "you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." Accordingly, major software releases are heavily audited by a 3rd party (Data Theorem), at least twice a year.</p>
