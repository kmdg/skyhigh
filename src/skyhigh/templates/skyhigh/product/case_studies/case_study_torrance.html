                    <h3>Challenge:</h3>
                    <p>To improve its economies of scale, Torrance Memorial Medical Center (Torrance Memorial) grew rapidly over the last five years acquiring new business entities and expanding its physician network. This produced network sprawl and rapidly grew the workforce. Both new and old employees at Torrance Memorial were using more and more cloud computing services. Healthcare organizations are highly regulated entities due to privacy and medical records concerns. </p>
                    <p>Todd Felker, Torrance Memorial’s technical services manager, wanted to know exactly which services employees were using to ensure he could maintain high security and privacy standards. Felker also needed this information to put in place a cloud services security policy that was flexible enough to allow employees to use the tools they needed but granular enough to maintain rock-solid security and resource controls. He also had no easy way to rate the risk of the different cloud services.  With an IT security staff of only one person, Felker did not have sufficient resources to perform regular diligence on the risks posed by cloud services. “We had a Palo Alto Networks firewall that told us what types of services were in use along broad types, such as streaming video or remote storage,” says Felker. “But we didn’t want to block entire classes of services and we needed more detailed information to both understand usage and to craft a smart policy.” Felker needed a tool that would:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automatically and continuously discover all cloud services in use from Torrance Memorial’s expanding pool of employees and locations</li>
                        <li>Regularly analyze the risks of every discovered cloud service and provide an easy way to convert the analysis into actionable information and a well-defined cloud services policy</li>
                        <li>Identify the usage levels of cloud services in order to set priorities for adding support for new cloud services or moving users from single-user subscriptions to a better managed, more secure enterprise-level service tiers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Solution:</h3>
                    <div class="quote_right">I was amazed to see over 200 services in use, including many that I had never heard of before...</div>
                    <p>In February 2013, Torrance Memorial uploaded log files into the Skyhigh Networks Cloud Services Manager, a cloud-based discovery, analysis, and control service. Within minutes, Felker had received a discovery report from Skyhigh’s CloudRegistry&trade; identifying every cloud service used by Torrance Memorial employees. “I had expected to see 15 or so services. I was amazed to see more than 200 services in use, including many that I had never heard of before,” says Felker.  Equally important, Skyhigh’s CloudRisk&trade; tool immediately assigned to each discovered service a 1-to-10 risk rating based on a matrix of over 30 metrics pulled from both first-person research and automated monitoring tools. “Getting those risk ratings is just tremendously valuable. It is something we could never do on our own,” says Felker</p>
                    <p>Using Skyhigh Networks, Felker was able to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Discover all cloud services in use by Torrance Memorial employees</li>
                        <li>Continuously monitor for new services</li>
                        <li>Quickly rate the risk associated with each discovered cloud service, based on industry best-practice measures, and be notified of change in risk</li>
                        <li>Effectively manage cloud security risks from a single dashboard managed by a single employee using only a small portion of their workday</li>
                        <li>Easily map usage of cloud services by class or type to risks presented by specific service providers. Use these correlations to quickly build a smart cloud services policy</li>
                    </ul>
