                <h3>You know the story - the cloud is the answer to everything IT. But what about risk, compliance, governance, and smart business management? Does your organization have the visibility and control you need to manage risk, ensure cloud governance, and reduce costs?</h3>

                <p>While Gartner reports that 79% of enterprises use SaaS and that Cloud is the top priority for CIOs, the number one barrier to broader adoption, according to Morgan Stanley, is security (cited by 42% of respondents).  Add to that concerns over compliance and cost management, and it is clear that the market is young and evolving.</p>

                <p>IT was once the main provider and gatekeeper of applications, devices, and network access. However, today a Shadow IT environment hangs over every organization as end users adopt new cloud services, accessing them from anywhere on any device, often without IT approval or any other governance.<br /><br />We’ve studied this existence of Shadow IT and the results are startling:<br /><img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}skyhigh/img/rethink_graph.png" /></p>
